LOCATE RESOURCE METHOD
*This class will be derived from resource base class

*A method must first exist to query the particular item's index. Then this result is assigned to a var. This var gets passed to the next method

*maybe should keep the static current student and current resource var (in main program), but this time will hold the object

*maybe should be a query class that has student search and resrouce search
